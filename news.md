### Bug Fix: Maintain
**December 16, 2020** v0.3.1 of VirtualShip has been released, along with instructions to refurbish from predated versions all the way up to v0.3.0. A bug had been founded concerning the script file maintain.sh, so you will need to manually refurbish. Luckily, it can be done by copy and pasting the instructions in the release notes.
### Version 0.3.0 (Alpha) Released!
**December 12, 2020** v0.3.0 of VirtualShip has been released. This release introduces a major structural change to the VirtualShip project: we have separated the ```return.sh``` and ```refurbish.sh``` functions into separate folders within the Warehouse: ```return``` and ```refurbish```. This is for the ease of adding more products to a folder instead of a growing file. The speed of VirtualShip downloads have also been increased, and minor bugs have been fixed. Update to this version from an existing install by entering ```ship refurbish ship``` in the terminal.
### New Product: aardvark_shell_utils

### Version 0.2.0 (Alpha) Released!
**December 7, 2020**: v0.2.0 of VirtualShip has been released. The release is a major developmental change to the overall VirtualShip project. Windows compatibility goals have been dropped due to demand. Package install has also been set as deprecated, as major issues could not be fixed. A script install milestone has been set in place (see above), and now VirtualShip only creates two folders.
