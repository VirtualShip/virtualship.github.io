# aalib
{: .no_toc }

[aalib](http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib/) is a portable ascii art GFX library. aalib's goals include simplicity and portability across operating systems. Furthermore, AA-lib replaces old-fashioned output methods with a powerful ascii-art renderer. AA-lib API is designed to be similar to other graphics libraries. Learning a new API would be a piece of cake!
