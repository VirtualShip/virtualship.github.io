## Getting started

### Dependencies

VirtualShip is designed to be very lightweight and uses the least number of dependencies as possible. The only things you need extra of a bash shell are:
* curl
* gh

```curl``` comes prepackaged with Mac OS, so you should disregard that as a dependency. Also, the binary of ```gh``` is installed with VirtualShip, so you can disregard that as well. What do we have here? No dependencies!
